## Developer notes

It's all a bit quick and dirty in terms of the code (remember this is a side project of a hobby).

The website is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) with the [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. It gets deployed on to the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) via a [Github](https://github.com) action. 

_Note that I'll use the words "website" and "app" interchangeably._

### Getting started

To run the website locally, you will need [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer, if you don't already.

You'll also need [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or [**npm**](npmjs.com/)) to manage packages.

#### Run these commands in your Terminal

Once you have your dependancies (Node and Yarn) run the following scripts from your Terminal.

To install or upgrade the app:

```bash
yarn
```

To start the running the website:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the website running in dev mode.
