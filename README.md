## Developer notes

It's all a bit quick and dirty in terms of the code (remember this is a side project of a hobby).

The website is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) with the [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. It gets deployed on to the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) via a [Github](https://github.com) action. 

_Note that I'll use the words "website" and "app" interchangeably._

### Getting started

To run the website locally, you will need [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer, if you don't already have it I recommend installing via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

You'll also need [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/) to manage packages.

#### Run these commands in your Terminal

Once you have the pre-requisits installed (Node and pnpm) run the following scripts from your Terminal:

To install or upgrade the app:

```bash
pnpm
```

To start the app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the website running in dev mode.
