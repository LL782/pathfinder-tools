## Developer notes

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application, using the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework and deployed on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) via [Github](https://github.com).

### Getting Started

You will need **Node** on your machine to run the app locally.

We use, [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installations. And we use [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/) rather than **npm**.

```bash
# run in your terminal
npm install
# or
yarn
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
